\p{
  The [constructible sets](topl-F1KS) on #{\spec D} are finite unions of subsets of the form #{O_a \cap C_b} for #{a,b \in D}.
}
\proof{
  This is a direct consequence of \ref{idem-comm-CJ99}, and that all compact opens are of the form #{O_a} for some #{a\in D}, with its complement being #{C_a}.
}
