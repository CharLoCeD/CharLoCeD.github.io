\title{Subspace of pro-open quotients}
\import{macro}

\p{
  For a filter #{F}, via \ref{idem-comm-W57Q} the spectrum #{\spec D/F} can be naturally seen as a subspace of #{\spec D}, which is given by 
  ##{ \spec D/F = \scomp{x\in\spec D}{\fa{a}{F} x \models a} = \bigcap_{a\in F}O_a, }
  This subspace will be \em{upward closed}, but in general may \em{fail} to be open in #{\spec D}, since it is an infinite intersection of basic opens. This is the reason why we call quotients of the form #{D \surj D/F} [pro-open](idem-comm-0002), rather than \em{open}.
