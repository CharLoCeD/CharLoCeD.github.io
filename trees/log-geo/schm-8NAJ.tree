\p{
  For a bounded linear order #{L}, recall from \ref{idem-comm-2XKS} #{\spec L \cong \mc{U}_+(L)}. For any upward closed subset #{x} of #{L}, we have
  ##{ \rg{L,x} \cong \ct_{p\in x}L/p \cong L/x, }
  where #{L/x} is simply the quotient of #{L} by identifying #{x} with #{1} and the others remaining the same. In particular, each stalk is again a linear lattice.
